# Gain awareness of Ansible meetups

## What is an Ansible Meetup?

Ansible meetup is a gathering of a small to medium-sized group of Systems Engineers, DevOps and SREs. Where they talk about their Automation journey focusing on Ansible, it is a place to teach and learn from each other. Meetup provides a platform for upstream and downstream to meet and share ideas.
