# Gain awareness of Ansible meetups

## What is an Ansible Meetup?

Ansible meetup is a gathering of a small to medium-sized group of Systems Engineers, DevOps and SREs. Where they talk about their Automation journey focusing on Ansible, it is a place to teach and learn from each other. Meetup provides a platform for upstream and downstream to meet and share ideas.

## How to become a member of the meetup?

One can be a member of an Ansible meetup group by

### Attending the meetups

Check the list of current Ansible meetups. If there is already a meetup in your area, join it and register for an upcoming event.

### Presenting at the meetup

Do you want to present at an Ansible meetup? Do you have an idea for a session? Feel free to reach out to the meetup group either by

- Commenting on the meetup page itself.
- Contacting the organizers via meetup.com direct messages.
- Open an issue at the [Github repo of the meetup group](https://github.com/ansible-community/?q=meetup) (if available).
- Share your idea at [#ansible-social](https://matrix.to/#/#social:ansible.com) Matrix room or one of the [regional rooms](https://matrix.to/#/#ansible-regional:matrix.org).


Meetup organizers always look for good presenters to enrich their events and meetup groups. So do not hold back from sharing your ideas.

### Hosting a meetup

Want to host a meeting at your organization? Then please reach out
 - by commenting on the meetup page of the local meetup
 - via social media
 - send us an [email](meetup@ansible.com)

### Organizing a meetup

No Ansible meetup in your area? Send us an [email](meetup@ansible.com) introducing yourself. Be sure to include a link to your profile at meetup.com.

We want to be sure that meetup organizers are committed to building a strong local community of Ansible users. After a brief discussion, we will create the Ansible meetup group in your area, appoint you as a co-organizer, and announce your new group to the world.

Secure a date and location for your first meetup! We will help you by spreading the word on social media, reaching out to potential speakers and sponsors in your area, and suggesting new and interesting Ansible content on a regular basis.

## Who can become an organizer?

Anyone from the wider Ansible community who is committed to run an Ansible meetup group and plan/organize meetups can become an organizer. The fundamental understanding of the Open Source community, its working, and the belief in this ethos is essential to be an efficient community builder. Some knowledge about Ansible is always a plus.

## Ansible Community Code of Conduct

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html

# Start planning

Now you seem ready and confident to run an Ansible meetup group. Amazing, here is what you have to do.

## Mode of the meetup

There are two main ways to conduct a meetup, Online and In-person.

### Online Meetup

The following is a checklist for having an online meetup

    - Platform to host the meetup
    - Fix a date and time
    - Speaker outreach
    - Social media promotion plans
    - Platform to have a conversation with the attendees, speakers, and organizers

An online meetup allows you to connect to a broader audience living in different time zones along with the regular meetup group members.  The organizers may want to promote the event on the social media platforms of the time zones coinciding with the event timing to extend the reach of the group.

### In Person meetup

The following is a checklist for having a in person meetup

    - Venue to host the meetup
    - Fix a date and time for the meetup
    - Speaker outreach
    - Sponsorship Scout
    - Social media promotion plans
    - Platform to have a conversation with the attendees, speakers, and organizers


## Finding speaker

Selecting the topics forms the core of any meetup group. Before looking for speakers, if the organizing pays heed to these points, that will be helpful.

What kind of audience are you expecting in the meetup? What is their experience with Ansible and with Automation in general?

Here are a few place for speaker outreach :
      1. Social media, email
      2. Community events
      3. Github contributions
      4. Ansible Community Communication platform

While reaching out to the speakers, one has to be careful to refrain from spamming people to give talks at the meetups. If you know the person or someone who can introduce them, that would be wonderful. And if not, a personal touch to the message is necessary for the person to know you, your intention, and your ideas, so they can make a reasoned decision about accepting or declining the invite. Here are some template messages which might be helpful in this process.

## Planning tools

In addition to the meetup.com group, we can create a repo for your meetup group on https://github.com/ansible-community/

You can use the repo to:

1. Get talk ideas and proposals for upcoming meetups from your meetup group
2. Upload and share presentation slides / code samples from speakers
3. Create an issue per event to gather feedback from attendees


## Session ideas

1. What is Ansible?
2. Ansible 101
3. Writing your first playbook
4. How to contribute to Ansible?
5. From Playbook to Rulebook (presentaion for EDA)
6. Ansible Ecosystem


## Venue Scout

Any in-person event can not happen without a venue. After confirming the speaker(s), a venue is the next most important thing to secure. There are some templates in the email template section which might be helpful in the journey of venue scout.

## Sponsor Scout
 
Meetups don't happen without places to have them, and everyone appreciates food at a meetup. As meetup organizers need sponsors to support their community. There are some email/message templates in the Resources Section below to help you with the sponsor scout.

## Promotion
 
Promotions help us to create awareness about the event. This is an important tool for outreach and the way one can spread news about their event around the world. In the Ansible Community we have certain platforms which one can promote the meetups on. 

### Bullhorn

The Bullhorn is our newsletter for the Ansible contributor community. Read past issues on the official [Bullhorn’s wiki page](https://github.com/ansible/community/wiki/News#the-bullhorn). Bullhorn gives the reach to spread your message across in the Ansible Community Worldwide.

But how to promote your event in Bullhorn?

Simply hop into [#social:ansible.com (the Ansible Social room on Matrix)](https://matrix.to/#/#social:ansible.com) and leave a message, tagging `@newsbot`. Posts to be made in markdown format. 

  
### Social Media Promotion

Social media plays an important role there. There are some social media post templates in the Resources Section below to help you with the sponsor scout. Ansible has social media presence in the following platforms

[Linked](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ansible/)
[LinkedIn Ansible User groups](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/4648083/)
[Mastodon](@ansible@fosstodon.org)
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ansible)

 
While posting about the event please tag the above mentioned handles for extended reach. There are some social media templates in the Resources Section below to help you with Social Media Promotion. While doing the promotion make sure to tag the willing attendees and of course the sponsor(s) of the event.

# During the Event


## Guidelines

Now the Big day is here, the day of the event. And you are all ready for it 🙂. Now here are the Guidelines to follow  during the day of the meetup. These are some steps that, if you follow it, will make your life easier as an organizer.

**Strict Guidelines****

1. Follow the Ansible Community Code of Conduct at all times during the event.
2. Be Inclusive 
3. Take care of the Security concerns.
4. Make sure to announce the name of the person of contact in case of CoC violation.
5. Mode of communication in case of CoC complaints.
6. Make sure that you have a First Aid kit ready.
7. Ask for permission of the attendees, speakers and volunteers  to be photographed.
8. Ask for permission of the attendees, speakers and volunteers  to be tagged in Social Media.

**Good to follow Guidelines

1. Time Management

Start and end the event on time. This creates a good practice and 
impression of the meetup group. 

2. Round table introduction

A round table introduction before the meetup helps us to create a network with the attendees. This helps the organizers to know them, their work and experience level better. Manier times you might get your future speaker, organizer or volunteer for the group from there. Therefore be frank in asking for help. 

3. Feedback session

An honest and frank feedback session at the end of the meetup is essential. Encourage the participants to comment on the meetup page or fill up the meetup.com feedback form for giving their feedback.You can ask the following questions in there :


- How was the event ? 
- Was it helpful for the attedees?
- How can the meetup improve?
- What are the topics you would like to hear more about in future sessions?

5. Fix the plan for the next session

It is advisable to plan the next event, the date, venue and brief agenda at the end of the meetup. So the attendees leave  with a definitive date to be booked on their calendar. Also it gives them some idea where the community is heading. Once you make the plan with the attendees they feel more inclusive. Giving their wishes priority  you essentially make them feel a part of the group itself.

6. How to connect with the Ansible Community?

Encourage the attendees to join the Ansible Community Matrix channel and show them how to join Matrix if they are not there.
Join the Ansible Community Matrix space, find a regional channel they can connect in. Start a local telegram/Signal/WhatsApp group with the attendees.

## Presentation Templates

There are some presentation templates in the Resources Section below to help you with the presentation ideas and giving those ideas the form of presentation.
Past Talks 

You can get ideas for talks from the list of the old talks in here. 

https://github.com/ansible-community/?q=meetup

# Post Event Activities

## Gathering Feedback 


It is essential to gather feedback from the participants about the meet at the end of the meetup.It gives us insght on how we, the meetup organizers can improve the meetup content and in any and every way. Presently we use the following platforms to gather feedback :

- meetup.com (Feedback tool)
- Email
- In-person feedback during the meetup
- Relevant Ansible Matrix room 

## Plan for the next meetup 

Decide on the frequency of the meetup you as a group want to have it and then plan for the meetup as soon as possible after the current meetup is over. It gives attendees time in advance to plan for the meetup. Also encourage attendees to share the content for the meetup topic using any of the abovementioned tools and platforms. The meetup groups at liberty to use their preffered platform for communication. In helps to keep the connection alive as well.

# Resources

Here are some example emails, social media posts to help the organizers with the different set communication while planning and excuting the meetup. The community members are welcome to share their ideas and contribute to the resources in the by sending a Pull Request [`ansible-community/meetup` Github repository](https://github.com/ansible-community/meetup).
