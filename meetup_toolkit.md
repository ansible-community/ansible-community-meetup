# Gain awareness of Ansible meetups

## What is an Ansible Meetup?

Ansible meetup is a gathering of a small to medium-sized group of Systems Engineers, DevOps and SREs. Where they talk about their Automation journey focusing on Ansible, it is a place to teach and learn from each other. Meetup provides a platform for upstream and downstream to meet and share ideas.

## How to become a member of the meetup?

One can be a member of an Ansible meetup group by

### Attending the meetups

Check the list of current Ansible meetups. If there is already a meetup in your area, join it and register for an upcoming event.

### Presenting at the meetup

Do you want to present at an Ansible meetup? Do you have an idea for a session? Feel free to reach out to the meetup group either by

- Commenting on the meetup page itself.
- Contacting the organizers via meetup.com direct messages.
- Open an issue at the [Github repo of the meetup group](https://github.com/ansible-community/?q=meetup) (if available).
- Share your idea at [#ansible-social](https://matrix.to/#/#social:ansible.com) Matrix room or one of the [regional rooms](https://matrix.to/#/#ansible-regional:matrix.org).


Meetup organizers always look for good presenters to enrich their events and meetup groups. So do not hold back from sharing your ideas.

### Hosting a meetup

Want to host a meeting at your organization? Then please reach out
 - by commenting on the meetup page of the local meetup
 - via social media
 - send us an [email](meetup@ansible.com)

### Organizing a meetup

No Ansible meetup in your area? Send us an [email](meetup@ansible.com) introducing yourself. Be sure to include a link to your profile at meetup.com.

We want to be sure that meetup organizers are committed to building a strong local community of Ansible users. After a brief discussion, we will create the Ansible meetup group in your area, appoint you as a co-organizer, and announce your new group to the world.

Secure a date and location for your first meetup! We will help you by spreading the word on social media, reaching out to potential speakers and sponsors in your area, and suggesting new and interesting Ansible content on a regular basis.

## Who can become an organizer?

Anyone from the wider Ansible community who is committed to run an Ansible meetup group and plan/organize meetups can become an organizer. The fundamental understanding of the Open Source community, its working, and the belief in this ethos is essential to be an efficient community builder. Some knowledge about Ansible is always a plus.

## Ansible Community Code of Conduct

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html

# Start planning

Now you seem ready and confident to run an Ansible meetup group. Amazing, here is what you have to do.

## Mode of the meetup

There are two main ways to conduct a meetup, Online and In-person.

### Online Meetup

The following is a checklist for having an online meetup

    - Platform to host the meetup
    - Fix a date and time
    - Speaker outreach
    - Social media promotion plans
    - Platform to have a conversation with the attendees, speakers, and organizers

An online meetup allows you to connect to a broader audience living in different time zones along with the regular meetup group members.  The organizers may want to promote the event on the social media platforms of the time zones coinciding with the event timing to extend the reach of the group.

### In Person meetup

The following is a checklist for having a in person meetup

    - Venue to host the meetup
    - Fix a date and time for the meetup
    - Speaker outreach
    - Sponsorship Scout
    - Social media promotion plans
    - Platform to have a conversation with the attendees, speakers, and organizers


## Finding/selecting speaker(s)

Selecting the topics forms the core of any meetup group. Before looking for speakers, if the organizing pays heed to these points, that will be helpful.

What kind of audience are you expecting in the meetup? What is their experience with Ansible and with Automation in general?

Here are a few place for speaker outreach :
      1. Social media, email
      2. Community events
      3. Github contributions
      4. Ansible Community Communication platform

While reaching out to the speakers, one has to be careful to refrain from spamming people to give talks at the meetups. If you know the person or someone who can introduce them, that would be wonderful. And if not, a personal touch to the message is necessary for the person to know you, your intention, and your ideas, so they can make a reasoned decision about accepting or declining the invite. Here are some template messages which might be helpful in this process.

## Planning tools/platforms

In addition to the meetup.com group, we can create a repo for your meetup group on https://github.com/ansible-community/

You can use the repo to:

1. Get talk ideas and proposals for upcoming meetups from your meetup group
2. Upload and share presentation slides / code samples from speakers
3. Create an issue per event to gather feedback from attendees


## Session ideas

1. What is Ansible?
2. Ansible 101
3. Writing your first playbook
4. How to contribute to Ansible?
5. From Playbook to Rulebook (presentaion for EDA)
6. Ansible Ecosystem
