Planning is key to a successful event, so lets go through some of the things you'll want to think about.

## Mode of the meetup

There are two main ways to conduct a meetup, Online and In-person.

### Online Meetup

The following is a checklist for having an online meetup

    - Platform to host the meetup
    - Fix a date and time
    - Speaker outreach
    - Social media promotion plans
    - Platform to have a conversation with the attendees, speakers, and organizers

An online meetup allows you to connect to a broader audience living in different time zones along with the regular meetup group members.  The organizers may want to promote the event on the social media platforms of the time zones coinciding with the event timing to extend the reach of the group.

### In Person meetup

The following is a checklist for having a in person meetup

    - Venue to host the meetup
    - Fix a date and time for the meetup
    - Speaker outreach
    - Sponsorship Scout
    - Social media promotion plans
    - Platform to have a conversation with the attendees, speakers, and organizers


## Finding speaker

Selecting the topics forms the core of any meetup group. Before looking for speakers, if the organizer pays heed to these points, that will be helpful.

What kind of audience are you expecting in the meetup? What is their experience with Ansible and with Automation in general?

Here are a few places for speaker outreach :
      1. Social media, email
      2. Community events
      3. Github contributions
      4. Ansible Community Communication platform

While reaching out to the speakers, one has to be careful to refrain from spamming people to give talks at the meetups. If you know the person or someone who can introduce them, that would be wonderful. And if not, a personal touch to the message is necessary for the person to know you, your intention, and your ideas, so they can make a reasoned decision about accepting or declining the invite. See the Email templates section which might be helpful in this process.

## Planning tools

In addition to the meetup.com group, we can create a repo for your meetup group on https://github.com/ansible-community/

You can use the repo to:

1. Get talk ideas and proposals for upcoming meetups from your meetup group
2. Upload and share presentation slides / code samples from speakers
3. Create an issue per event to gather feedback from attendees


## Session ideas

1. What is Ansible?
2. Ansible 101
3. Writing your first playbook
4. How to contribute to Ansible?
5. From Playbook to Rulebook (presentaion for EDA)
6. Ansible Ecosystem


## Finding a Venue

Any in-person event can not happen without a venue. There are some templates in the resources  section which might be helpful in the journey of venue scout.

## Sponsor Scout

Meetups don't happen without places to have them, and everyone appreciates food at a meetup. As meetup organizers need sponsors to support their community. There are some email/message templates in the Resources Section below to help you with the sponsor scout.

## Promotion

Promotions help us to create awareness about the event. This is an important tool for outreach and the way one can spread news about their event around the world. In the Ansible Community we have certain platforms which one can promote the meetups on.

### Bullhorn

The Bullhorn is our newsletter for the Ansible contributor community. Read past issues on the official [Bullhornâ€™s wiki page](https://github.com/ansible/community/wiki/News#the-bullhorn).The Bullhorn gives you the reach to spread your message across in the Ansible Community worldwide.

But how to promote your event in Bullhorn?

Simply hop into [#social:ansible.com (the Ansible Social room on Matrix)](https://matrix.to/#/#social:ansible.com) and leave a message, tagging `@newsbot`. Posts should be in Markdown format.


### Social Media Promotion

Social media plays an important role in raising awareness of your event. There are some social media post templates in the Resources Section below to help you with the sponsor scout. Ansible has social media presence in the following platforms

While posting about the event please tag the above mentioned handles for extended reach. There are some social media templates in the Resources Section below to help you with Social Media Promotion. While doing the promotion make sure to tag the willing attendees and of course the sponsor(s) of the event.
